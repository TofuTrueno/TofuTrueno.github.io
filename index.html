  <p style="font-size:50px; color:crimson;">Old Watch</p>
  <p>This was a picture that I had taken in a photography class where the assignment was to take a pair of photos that show the exact same thing but are somewhat different. From that I did this pair of photos with a modern watch and a replica of a pocket watch and held them in the same location. I also took the photo with the intenet of focusing on the watch so that's why the background is blurry.</p>
  <p> </p>

  <p style="font-size:50px; color:crimson;">Modern Watch</p>
  <p>The other half of the pair for my photography assignment but instead of a pocket watch its a modern day wrist watch in the same location. This photo would probably more like the other if I didn't wear the watch properly and decided to hold it in my hand like the pocket watch.</p>

  <p style="font-size:50px; color:crimson;">Night</p>
  <p>This photo was taken around my second week during the photography course and it was to mess with iso. I took this in my neighborhood during the evening. A normal photo would show a regular sunset but in this photo I was using a high iso allowing more light into the image and it made the sky look much brighter at this time of day.</p>

  <p style="font-size:50px; color:crimson;">City</p>
  <p>In the first week of my photography class we were given a simple assignment to go and take a few photos using some basics we learned. This photo was one of the few I took in downtown Seattle and I wanted to get some shots of the buildings there. My focus in this photo was the building reflecting off of the other and I was using a low iso on the camera at the time to get a better image when the sun was out and that created this blue color effect on the buildings.  </p>
